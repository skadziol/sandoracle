# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement RIG Agent Integration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Integrate the RIG AI framework for intelligent opportunity evaluation and decision making.
# Details:
Create the rig_agent module with integration to the RIG AI framework. Implement market data integration for AI decision making. Develop opportunity evaluation using transaction patterns and market conditions. Implement confidence rating system (0-1 scale) for opportunities. Create fallback mechanisms to rule-based decisions when needed. Implement explainable decision reasoning for monitoring and debugging.

# Test Strategy:
Test AI decision making with historical data to validate accuracy. Compare AI decisions against rule-based approaches to measure improvements. Verify confidence ratings correlate with actual profitability. Test fallback mechanisms by simulating AI failures.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create rig_agent module with RIG AI framework integration [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the foundational rig_agent module that connects to the RIG AI framework and establishes the basic agent architecture for opportunity evaluation.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a new rig_agent.py module with appropriate class structure
2. Implement authentication and connection to the RIG AI framework API
3. Set up configuration handling for API keys and endpoints
4. Create basic agent methods (initialize, evaluate, decide)
5. Implement a simple agent state management system
6. Add logging and error handling for API communication
7. Create unit tests that mock the RIG AI API responses
8. Document the module's public interface

Testing approach:
- Write unit tests with mocked API responses to verify connection and authentication
- Test error handling with simulated API failures
- Validate configuration loading from environment variables and config files

## 2. Implement market data integration and opportunity evaluation [done]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Enhance the rig_agent to consume market data and implement the core opportunity evaluation logic using transaction patterns and market conditions.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Extend the rig_agent to accept market data inputs (prices, volumes, order book data)
2. Create data transformation functions to prepare market data for the RIG AI framework
3. Implement methods to identify transaction patterns in market data
4. Develop market condition analysis functions (volatility, trend detection, etc.)
5. Create opportunity evaluation logic that combines pattern recognition with market conditions
6. Implement the confidence rating system (0-1 scale) for evaluated opportunities
7. Add caching mechanisms for API responses to improve performance
8. Create integration tests with sample market datasets

Testing approach:
- Test data transformation with known input/output pairs
- Validate pattern recognition with historical data samples
- Test confidence rating calculations with benchmark scenarios
- Measure performance with large datasets to ensure scalability

## 3. Develop decision reasoning and fallback mechanisms [done]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2
### Description: Complete the rig_agent implementation with explainable decision reasoning and fallback mechanisms to rule-based decisions when AI confidence is low.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Implement extraction of decision reasoning factors from RIG AI responses
2. Create a structured format for decision explanations (factors, weights, confidence)
3. Develop threshold-based logic to determine when to use AI vs. fallback mechanisms
4. Implement rule-based decision algorithms for fallback scenarios
5. Create a decision audit trail system for monitoring and debugging
6. Add visualization helpers for decision reasoning (for debugging console or UI)
7. Implement performance analytics to track AI vs. rule-based decision quality
8. Create comprehensive end-to-end tests with realistic market scenarios

Testing approach:
- Test fallback threshold behavior with various confidence levels
- Validate explanation generation with complex decision scenarios
- Test audit trail completeness and accuracy
- Create integration tests that verify the entire decision pipeline from market data to final decision with reasoning
