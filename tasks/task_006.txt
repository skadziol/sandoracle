# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement RIG Agent Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Integrate the RIG AI framework for intelligent opportunity evaluation and decision making.
# Details:
Create the rig_agent module with integration to the RIG AI framework. Implement market data integration for AI decision making. Develop opportunity evaluation using transaction patterns and market conditions. Implement confidence rating system (0-1 scale) for opportunities. Create fallback mechanisms to rule-based decisions when needed. Implement explainable decision reasoning for monitoring and debugging.

# Test Strategy:
Test AI decision making with historical data to validate accuracy. Compare AI decisions against rule-based approaches to measure improvements. Verify confidence ratings correlate with actual profitability. Test fallback mechanisms by simulating AI failures.
