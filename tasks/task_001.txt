# Task ID: 1
# Title: Project Setup and Repository Initialization
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project repository with necessary dependencies, configuration files, and basic project structure.
# Details:
Create a new Rust project with Cargo. Set up the project structure as outlined in the Technical Architecture section. Initialize Git repository. Configure Cargo.toml with all required dependencies including Solana SDK, RPC Client, Tokio async runtime, listen-engine, and rig framework. Create basic configuration files for environment variables. Implement error handling module (error.rs) with custom error types for different system components.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the project builds successfully with cargo build. Ensure all dependencies resolve correctly. Check that the directory structure matches the specified architecture.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize Rust Project with Git Repository and Core Dependencies [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a new Rust project using Cargo, set up Git version control, and configure essential dependencies in Cargo.toml including Solana SDK and RPC Client.
### Details:
1. Create a new Rust project using `cargo new project_name --lib` command
2. Initialize Git repository with `git init`
3. Create a comprehensive .gitignore file for Rust projects (include target/, Cargo.lock for libraries, .env files, etc.)
4. Configure Cargo.toml with metadata (name, version, authors, edition, description)
5. Add core dependencies to Cargo.toml:
   - solana-sdk = "~1.16.0"
   - solana-client = "~1.16.0"
   - solana-program = "~1.16.0"
   - tokio = { version = "1.28.0", features = ["full"] }
6. Add development dependencies:
   - anyhow = "1.0"
   - thiserror = "1.0"
7. Create README.md with project description, setup instructions, and basic usage
8. Make initial commit with descriptive message
Testing approach: Verify project builds successfully with `cargo check` and `cargo build`. Ensure Git repository is properly initialized by checking `git status` and `git log`.

## 2. Implement Project Directory Structure and Configuration Management [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Set up the project's directory structure according to the Technical Architecture, implement configuration management for environment variables, and add additional specialized dependencies.
### Details:
1. Create the following directory structure under src/:
   - lib.rs (main entry point)
   - error.rs (for error handling)
   - config.rs (for configuration)
   - models/ (for data models)
   - services/ (for business logic)
   - utils/ (for utility functions)
2. Add specialized dependencies to Cargo.toml:
   - listen-engine (ensure correct version)
   - rig (ensure correct version)
   - serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
   - serde_json = "1.0"
   - dotenv = "0.15.0"
   - config = "0.13.3"
3. Implement config.rs with:
   - Environment variable loading using dotenv
   - Configuration struct with all required settings
   - Function to load configuration from environment or files
4. Create .env.example file with all required environment variables (without actual values)
5. Add tests directory with basic test setup
Testing approach: Write unit tests for configuration loading. Test with different environment variables to ensure proper loading and fallback to defaults.

## 3. Implement Error Handling Module and Project Integration [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2
### Description: Create a comprehensive error handling module with custom error types for different system components, and ensure all project components are properly integrated.
### Details:
1. Implement error.rs module with:
   - Create a custom Error enum using thiserror for type-safe error handling
   - Define specific error variants for different components:
     - ConfigError for configuration issues
     - SolanaClientError for Solana RPC client errors
     - ValidationError for input validation errors
     - ServiceError for business logic errors
   - Implement From traits for converting standard errors to custom errors
   - Add context methods for adding additional information to errors
2. Update lib.rs to:
   - Export all public modules
   - Provide a clean API surface
   - Include high-level documentation
3. Create a minimal working example in examples/ directory demonstrating basic functionality
4. Implement CI/CD setup with GitHub Actions:
   - Create .github/workflows/ci.yml for continuous integration
   - Configure workflow to run tests, linting, and build checks
5. Finalize README.md with complete setup and usage instructions
Testing approach: Write unit tests for error handling scenarios. Ensure errors propagate correctly and contain helpful information. Verify the CI/CD pipeline runs successfully.
