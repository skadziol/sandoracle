# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Transaction Executor
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Build the Transaction Executor component to simulate and execute trades based on identified opportunities.
# Details:
Create the transaction execution module with wallet integration. Implement transaction simulation before execution to validate profitability and safety. Develop gas optimization and priority fee management. Build support for basic MEV strategies (start with arbitrage). Implement detailed execution tracking and confirmation. Create a simulation mode for testing without actual execution. Include retry mechanisms for failed transactions.

# Test Strategy:
Test transaction simulation with known profitable and unprofitable scenarios. Verify wallet integration with test wallets. Measure execution time to ensure it meets the <2s requirement. Test the simulation mode to confirm it accurately predicts outcomes.
