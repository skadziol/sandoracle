# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Transaction Executor
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Build the Transaction Executor component to simulate and execute trades based on identified opportunities.
# Details:
Create the transaction execution module with wallet integration. Implement transaction simulation before execution to validate profitability and safety. Develop gas optimization and priority fee management. Build support for basic MEV strategies (start with arbitrage). Implement detailed execution tracking and confirmation. Create a simulation mode for testing without actual execution. Include retry mechanisms for failed transactions.

# Test Strategy:
Test transaction simulation with known profitable and unprofitable scenarios. Verify wallet integration with test wallets. Measure execution time to ensure it meets the <2s requirement. Test the simulation mode to confirm it accurately predicts outcomes.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Transaction Simulation Module [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a transaction simulation system that can estimate gas costs, validate profitability, and ensure transaction safety before actual execution.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a SimulationEngine class that accepts transaction parameters (contract addresses, function calls, amounts)
2. Implement fork-state simulation using eth_call to test transaction outcomes without execution
3. Build profitability calculator that compares expected returns against gas costs
4. Add safety validation checks (slippage protection, expected output verification)
5. Implement gas estimation with buffer for network fluctuations
6. Create simulation result object with detailed breakdown of expected outcomes
7. Add logging for simulation results

Testing approach:
- Unit tests with mock blockchain responses
- Integration tests using forked mainnet state
- Test various scenarios including profitable and unprofitable trades
- Validate gas estimation accuracy against historical transactions

## 2. Implement Wallet Integration and Transaction Execution [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Build the core transaction execution module with wallet integration, retry mechanisms, and detailed execution tracking.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create TransactionExecutor class that accepts simulation results from subtask 1
2. Implement wallet integration with support for multiple wallet providers (MetaMask, hardware wallets, private keys)
3. Build secure key management and transaction signing functionality
4. Develop transaction submission with configurable gas strategies (fast, normal, economic)
5. Implement priority fee management based on network congestion
6. Create transaction tracking system with pending/confirmed/failed states
7. Build retry mechanism for failed transactions with configurable retry attempts and backoff strategy
8. Implement detailed logging of all transaction stages

Testing approach:
- Unit tests with mocked blockchain responses
- Integration tests on testnets
- Test retry mechanism with simulated failures
- Validate transaction receipts and confirmation handling

## 3. Develop Arbitrage Strategy and Simulation Mode [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2
### Description: Implement the first MEV strategy (arbitrage) and create a simulation mode for testing the entire execution pipeline without actual blockchain transactions.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create ArbitrageStrategy class that identifies price differences between exchanges/pools
2. Implement opportunity calculation logic with minimum profit thresholds
3. Build transaction construction for arbitrage (e.g., flash loans if needed)
4. Integrate with simulation module from subtask 1 to validate arbitrage opportunities
5. Connect to transaction executor from subtask 2 for execution
6. Implement simulation mode toggle that runs through entire pipeline without submitting transactions
7. Create detailed reporting for simulation mode showing potential profits
8. Add configuration options for risk parameters and profit thresholds

Testing approach:
- Unit tests for arbitrage calculations
- Integration tests with historical blockchain data
- End-to-end tests in simulation mode
- Compare simulation results with actual execution outcomes
- Test with various market conditions and token pairs
