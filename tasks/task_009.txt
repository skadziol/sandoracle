# Task ID: 9
# Title: Optimize System Performance
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 4, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enhance system performance focusing on latency optimization, parallel processing, and connection management.
# Details:
Implement connection pooling and failover for RPC connections. Optimize critical paths for minimal latency. Implement parallel processing for transaction evaluation and execution. Enhance error recovery mechanisms for improved reliability. Implement adaptive rate limiting to prevent API throttling. Create performance benchmarking tools for continuous optimization.

# Test Strategy:
Conduct load testing to measure system performance under stress. Compare latency metrics before and after optimization. Test failover scenarios to verify seamless recovery. Measure system uptime during extended operation periods to validate 99.9% uptime target.
