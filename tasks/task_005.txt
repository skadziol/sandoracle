# Task ID: 5
# Title: Develop Essential Monitoring System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement basic monitoring and logging functionality to track system performance and operations.
# Details:
Create the monitoring module with comprehensive trade logging. Implement system health monitoring for key components. Develop basic notification system (console/file-based initially). Create performance metrics tracking including latency, success rates, and profitability. Implement error tracking and reporting. Design the monitoring system to be extensible for future enhancements.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that all system events are properly logged. Test error scenarios to ensure appropriate error handling and logging. Validate that performance metrics are accurately recorded and can be retrieved for analysis.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Core Logging Infrastructure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish the foundational logging infrastructure for capturing system events, trades, and errors
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Design and implement a centralized Logger class that supports multiple log levels (INFO, WARNING, ERROR, DEBUG)
2. Create specialized logging methods for trade execution, order placement, and order cancellation events
3. Implement file-based logging with proper rotation and retention policies
4. Develop structured logging format (JSON) to facilitate future analysis
5. Add context information to logs (timestamp, component, operation type)
6. Implement error capturing with stack traces

Testing approach:
- Create unit tests with mock events to verify correct logging format and content
- Test log rotation functionality with simulated high-volume logging
- Verify error capturing by intentionally triggering exceptions

## 2. Implement System Health Monitoring [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Create a health monitoring system to track the status and performance of key system components
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Create a HealthMonitor class that periodically checks status of critical components
2. Implement component health checks for: database connections, API endpoints, message queues
3. Design a system to track and store component status history
4. Create performance metrics collection for latency measurement across system operations
5. Implement success/failure rate tracking for trade operations
6. Develop profitability tracking to monitor strategy performance
7. Create a health dashboard data model for future UI integration

Testing approach:
- Write unit tests to verify metric collection accuracy
- Create component mock objects that simulate healthy and unhealthy states
- Test periodic health check scheduling
- Verify latency and success rate calculations with controlled inputs

## 3. Develop Notification System and Monitoring API [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2
### Description: Create a notification system for alerts and expose monitoring data through an API
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Design an AlertManager class to evaluate system conditions and trigger notifications
2. Implement configurable alert thresholds for system health, performance, and error conditions
3. Create console and file-based notification channels (initial implementation)
4. Design extensible notification architecture to support future channels (email, SMS, etc.)
5. Develop a RESTful API to expose monitoring data and system health status
6. Implement endpoints for historical performance metrics
7. Create filtering and query capabilities for log retrieval

Testing approach:
- Create unit tests for alert condition evaluation
- Test notification dispatch to different channels
- Verify API endpoints return correct monitoring data
- Test query filters for log retrieval
- Create integration tests to verify complete monitoring pipeline
