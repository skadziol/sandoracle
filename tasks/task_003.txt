# Task ID: 3
# Title: Develop Basic Opportunity Evaluator
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the foundation for the Opportunity Evaluator component with initial scoring system and risk assessment.
# Details:
Implement the evaluator module with interfaces for different MEV strategies. Create a basic multi-factor scoring system for MEV opportunities. Develop risk assessment functionality including profitability estimation. Implement configurable execution thresholds. Create a real-time go/no-go decision-making system based on opportunity scores. Design the system to be extensible for future strategy additions.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests with mock transaction data to verify scoring accuracy. Test different risk scenarios to ensure proper risk assessment. Validate that execution decisions align with configured thresholds.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Core Evaluator Interface and Strategy Abstraction [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the foundational structure for the Opportunity Evaluator with interfaces for different MEV strategies and the core evaluation pipeline.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Define an `OpportunityEvaluator` interface with methods like `evaluateOpportunity()` and `makeDecision()`.
2. Create an abstract `MevStrategy` class/interface that specific strategies will implement.
3. Implement a strategy registry that allows registering and retrieving different MEV strategy implementations.
4. Design the core evaluation pipeline that processes incoming opportunities.
5. Implement a basic opportunity data structure with essential fields like type, assets involved, estimated profit, etc.
6. Create unit tests for the interfaces and registry using mock strategies.
7. Implement logging for evaluation steps to aid debugging.

Testing approach: Write unit tests for the registry functionality and the core pipeline using mock strategy implementations to verify the architecture works as expected.

## 2. Develop Multi-Factor Scoring System [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Create a configurable scoring system that evaluates opportunities based on multiple factors and calculates an overall opportunity score.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Define a `ScoringFactor` interface that individual scoring components will implement.
2. Implement basic scoring factors such as:
   - Profitability factor (expected profit vs gas costs)
   - Risk factor (likelihood of success)
   - Complexity factor (computational requirements)
   - Time sensitivity factor (how quickly opportunity expires)
3. Create a weighted scoring algorithm that combines individual factor scores.
4. Implement configuration options for factor weights and thresholds.
5. Add methods to the core evaluator that utilize the scoring system.
6. Develop unit tests with various test cases for each factor.
7. Create integration tests that verify the combined scoring system produces expected results for sample opportunities.

Testing approach: Test each scoring factor individually with boundary cases, then test the combined scoring system with realistic opportunity data to verify it produces sensible scores.

## 3. Implement Decision-Making System with Execution Thresholds [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2
### Description: Create a real-time go/no-go decision-making system based on opportunity scores with configurable execution thresholds.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Design a `DecisionEngine` component that takes scoring results and makes execution decisions.
2. Implement configurable thresholds for different strategy types and market conditions.
3. Create a risk assessment module that estimates:
   - Probability of success
   - Potential downside if transaction fails
   - Gas price impact on profitability
4. Develop a profitability calculator that factors in gas costs, slippage, and other execution costs.
5. Implement a threshold configuration system that allows adjusting parameters without code changes.
6. Add circuit breakers for extreme market conditions or when consecutive failures occur.
7. Create comprehensive logging for decision rationale to aid in system improvement.
8. Develop integration tests that simulate various market scenarios and verify decisions.

Testing approach: Create a test suite with various opportunity scenarios (highly profitable, marginally profitable, unprofitable) and verify the decision engine makes appropriate go/no-go decisions based on configured thresholds.
