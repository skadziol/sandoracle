# Overview
SandoSeer is an autonomous MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) detection and execution system for the Solana blockchain. It leverages AI-powered decision making through the `rig` framework and real-time transaction monitoring via the `listen` engine to identify and capitalize on MEV opportunities including sandwich trading, arbitrage, and token sniping.

The system solves the challenge of efficiently identifying and executing profitable MEV opportunities on Solana by combining real-time transaction monitoring with AI-driven decision making. It's designed for traders and DeFi participants who want to automate MEV extraction while managing risks effectively.

# Core Features
